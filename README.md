# (WTF) Wild Tuxanossaurus FrameGeneration 
Wild Tuxanossaurus FrameGeneration _(WTF)_ Is a Frame Generation App for Linux.

**This project is a WIP and it is on the first stages of development, I'll ask you guys for pacience.**

**_To be clear with you I am using AI to help me make the app. (GPT, DeepSeek, Copilot, Etc.)_**

I got tired of waiting for someone to create something like this so I've decided to do it myself, As I don't know how to program, I decided to use AI to help me and I'm trying to learn along the way.

This app is being completely redesigned in terms of how it works and I will try to make it as modular as possible for anyone who wants to contribute to the code.
