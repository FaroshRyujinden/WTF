# Wild Tuxanossaurus FrameGeneration (WTF)
Wild Tuxanossaurus FrameGeneration (WTF) Is a Frame Generation App for Linux (Similar to Lossless Scaling Frame Gen).

**This project is a WIP and it is on the first stages of development, this is also my first attempt to code so I'll ask you guys for pacience cause I have no idea of what I'm doing.**

I got tired of waiting for someone to create something like this so I've decided to do it myself for fun and to learn how to code.

**Roadmap (Simplified)**

**1** - _Implement HYDRA (Hook Your Display: Raptor Attack) aka the Hook that captures the Game Window_ âœ…

**2** - _Implement OMG (Open-Source Mesozoic Glitches) aka FrameGen algorythm_ ðŸš« **(Basic algorythm ready, but App crashing when applied)**.

**3** - _Implement FDP (Frame Disaster Protocol) aka FPS Counter on Mangohud or as a independent overlay_ ðŸš«

**4** - _Have Fun_ âœ…

**Future Features (Maybe?)**

_**Tray Icon**_

_**GUI**_

_**AppImage Package**_
