# WTF
WTF (Wild Tuxanossaurus FrameGeneration) Is a Frame Generation App for Linux (Similar to Lossless Scaling Frame Gen) running as an Addon to Mangohud.

**This project is a WIP and it is on the first stages of development, this is also my first attempt to code so I'll ask you guys for pacience cause I have no idea of what I'm doing.**

I got tired of waiting for someone to create something like this so I've decided to do it myself for fun and to learn how to code.

**Roadmap (Simplified)**

**1** - _Implement H.Y.D.R.A (Hook Your Display: Raptor Attack) aka the Hook that captures the Games_

**2** - _Implement FDP (Frame Disaster Protocol) aka FPS Counter on Mangohud or as a independent overlay_

**3** - _Implement OMG (Open-Source Mesozoic Glitches) aka FrameGen algorythm_

**4** - _Have Fun_

**Future Features**

_**Velociraptor Sync**_ = V-Sync Support
